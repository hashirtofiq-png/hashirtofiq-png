## About Me

I'm Hashir Tofiq, a Computer Science undergraduate majoring in AI.

I focus on **identifying real problems**, building **AI-powered solutions**, and packaging them into **industry-ready web applications**.

My work lives at the intersection of **Generative AI, RAG systems, and backend engineering**.

Recently, I built a **YouTube RAG Web App** where users can paste a YouTube link, watch the video, and **chat with its content** in real time.

Currently, I’m going deeper into:
- Generative AI applications
- RAG systems
- Agentic AI workflows
