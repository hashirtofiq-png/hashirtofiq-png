## Hi there 👋

I'm Hashir, CS undergrad with major in AI.

I solve real-life problems by building complete AI solutions.

My main tech stack is Langchain, FastAPI, Python. My favorite projects are the one that involves genAI and RAG.

Recently, I built a "YouTube RAG Web App" where you can paste a YouTube video link, watch it and CHAT with it.

My current plan is build more in genAI and explore Agentic AI solutions.
